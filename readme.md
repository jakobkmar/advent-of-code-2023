# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my Advent of Code solutions for the year 2023.

You can find [the code for all solutions here](/src/main/kotlin).

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming puzzles contest held every December from the 1st to the 25th.
It's a great way to learn new skills, test your problem-solving abilities, and have fun.
